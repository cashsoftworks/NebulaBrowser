Please credit me if you use this! <3
You can download the built version [here](https://gofile.io/d/orDJDn) via gofile. I used gofile because stupid github wouldn't take a 101 mb file.

## Why?
* Just know this is a step to de-google the world and get rid of shitty spyware.
* Open sourced - build it yourself if you dont trust it.
* For devs - new devs can learn shit from this.
